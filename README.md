# Image-Recognition-Demo
Implementing multiple image recognition methods through deep learning

# Outline
### 1. Classic cats & dogs imgae classification
A quick runthrough of CNN using TensorFlow, perfect for starter. In the kaggle notebook, I implemented simple CNN with hyperparameter tunning and transfer learning based on InceptionV3, clearly the transfer learning model triumph in terms of accuracy among all the models I tried.
